# Cross-Platform Programming â€“ Lab Assignments

This repository contains laboratory assignments for the Cross-Platform Programming course. Each assignment is stored in a separate module and covers different aspects of cross-platform development.

## Lab List

### Lab 1.1: Basic Concepts. Computations

**Assignment** : Enter n numbers from the console. Find the number consisting only of different digits. If there are several such numbers, find the first one

### Lab 1.2: Basic Concepts. Strings

**Assignment** : Given the root of a binary tree, construct a string consisting of parenthesis and
integers from a binary tree with the preorder traversal way, and return it. Omit all the empty
parenthesis pairs that do not affect the one-to-one mapping relationship between the string
and the original binary tree.

**Example 1:**  
root = [1,2,3,4]  
**Result:**  
"1(2(4))(3)"

**Example 2:**  
root = [1,2,3,null,4]  
**Result:**  
"1(2()(4))(3)"

### Lab 2: OOP

**Assignment** : a) Define the class Complex Number. Create an array/list/set of dimension n from
complex coordinates. Pass it to a method that will add/multiply its elements.  
b) Define class Point in space whose coordinates are specified using a Complex
Number. Create methods for determining the distance between points and the
distance to the origin.


### Lab 3: Concurrency

**Assignment** : *CallCenter*  
The organization employs several operators. The operator can serve only one client, the rest
must wait in line. The client can hang up and call back again after a while.
